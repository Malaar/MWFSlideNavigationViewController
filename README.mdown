### About MWFSlideNavigationViewController

MWFSlideNavigationViewController is a container view controller that manages primary and secondary view controller. Primary view controller is the root view controller initialized with the controller. A secondary view controller can be revealed beneath the primary view controller with a slide navigation.

Imagine the latest facebook iphone app, a menu view beneath its main view is displayed when user taps on menu button. Or in Piggie app, sets of button are displayed when the lightning button is tapped.
